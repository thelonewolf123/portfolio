### The Story Behind the Android Python Editor

Let me take you on a thrilling journey of how I made my very own Python code editor and interpreter using the Android Flutter framework.

### Why Build a Code Editor?

While common app ideas like to-do lists and expense trackers are fine, I wanted to challenge myself and do something unique.

### The Beginning of the Adventure

It all started when a junior of mine asked for help with his freelance project. He was working on a Flutter app, a technology I wasn't familiar with. But I saw this as an opportunity to try something new and exciting.

### Step 1: Learning the Basics

To get started, I watched Flutter app development tutorials on YouTube. At first, I was unsure because I had never used Dart before. However, when I created my first app, I fell in love with the language and Flutter's way of building apps.

### Step 2: Laying the Foundation

I began by creating some simple apps like a clock and a to-do list. But I wanted a bigger challenge to showcase my skills. That's when I decided to build my own Python compiler. Many already existed, but building one from scratch was a thrilling challenge.

### Step 3: Let's Get Building

As I worked on the project, I faced my first hurdleâ€”Flutter didn't have a built-in code editor. Determined to find a solution, I decided to create my own. But I quickly realized that I wasn't as skilled in Flutter as I thought. So, I explored other options. I came up with a plan to integrate a web view into my app and use a web-based code editor. I chose CodeMirror, a lightweight editor that works well on touch devices. To make it work, I used Svelte to build a simple web app, and then I compiled it into a single file that could be easily used in my app.

### Step 4: Overcoming Challenges

The next challenge was building the interpreter. There were existing libraries for running Python code on Android, but I wanted to make it more interesting. So, I created my own API to run the code on a server and get the results back. Security was a big concern, as I needed to make sure each user's code was separate and safe. To handle that, I used a serverless function on AWS Lambda, which took care of the security.

### Step 5: Reaching the Finish Line

With everything connected and working smoothly, my project was a success. I had built my Android Python editor!
